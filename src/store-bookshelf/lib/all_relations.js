 * Return all relations names for a supplied model. It is expected that valid

 * for each model. These will be used to determine what appears in the `links`
 * object for a given entity.
 *
 * This is required because Bookshelf does not provide static analysis (yet),
 *
 * That said, once static analysis is available, it will be possible to
 * automatically detect relations. Even so, it will remain desirable to
 * support enumerating them manually, as this allows the user to specify
 * which relations should appear.
 *
 * TODO: support relations to external APIs.
 *
 * @param {Bookshelf.Model} model
 * @return {Array}
